`syfop` allows the user to model a network, where commodities run through nodes representing
certain types of technologies. In a second step, sizes of the nodes are optimized to be cost
optimal with respect to constraints introduced by the network. The optimization uses discrete time
series for all nodes on as pre-specified time interval.
